    <description>Mongol is a wrapper for the MongoDB Official C# Driver which makes it very easy to create repository pattern classes around strongly typed collections for POCO objects.  
    Mongol also includes lambda-based property name resolution for building MongoDB Query/Update operations without magic strings.</description>
    <projectUrl>https://github.com/pmarkert/Mongol</projectUrl>
    <summary>QuickStart:
    1. Install Nuget Package
    2. Set Mongol.Url appSetting with mongodb:// url
    3. Create POCO classes, and mark with [BsonId]
    4. Use instances of RecordManager&lt;TClass&gt; to perform basic repository operations.
    5. Extend RecordManager&lt;TClass&gt; to encapsulate operations for Query/Update using inherited methods, or directly access the collection.</summary>
